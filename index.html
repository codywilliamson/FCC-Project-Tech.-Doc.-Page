		<header><h3>What is GitHub?</h3></header>
		<p>
			GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like <em>repositories, branches, commits,</em> and <em>Pull Requests.</em> You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>You'll learn how to:</strong>
			<br>
		<ul class="section-lists">
			<li>Create and use a repository</li>
			<li>Navigate your way around your repository</li>
			<li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
			<li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
			<li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section" id="Create_a_Repository">
		<header><h3>Create a Repository</h3></header>
		<p>
			A <strong>repository</strong> is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a <em>README</em>, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. <em>It also offers other common options such as a license file.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Your <code>hello-world</code> repository can be a place where you	store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
		</p>
		<h4>To create a new respository</h4>
		<ol class="section-ol">
			<li>In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select <strong>New repository</strong>.</li>
			<li>Name your repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
			<li>Write a short description.</li>
			<li>Select <strong>Initialize this repository with a README</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Click <strong>Create repository.</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section" id="Create_a_Branch">
		<header><h3>Create a Branch</h3></header>
		<p>
			<strong>Branching</strong> is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
		</p>
		<p>
			By default your repository has one branch named <code>master</code> which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to <code>master</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you create a branch off the <code>master</code> branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of <code>master</code> as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the <code>master</code> branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
			<br>
			This diagram shows:
			<br>
			<ul class="section-lists">
				<li>The <code>master</code> branch</li>
				<li>A new branch called <code>feature</code> (because we're doing feature work on this branch)</li>
				<li>The journey that <code>feature</code> takes before it's merged into <code>master</code></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	<p>
		Developers, writers, designers, and such use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our <code>master</code> branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into <code>master</code>.
</p>
<h4>To create a new branch</h4>
<p>
	<ol class="section-ol">
		<li>Go to your new repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
		<li>Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says <strong>branch: master.</strong></li>
		<li>Type a branch name, <code>readme-edits</code>, into the new branch text box.</li>
		<li>Select the blue <strong>Create branch</strong> box or hit "Enter" on your keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Now you have two branches, <code>master</code> and <code>readme-edits</code>. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we'll add our changes to the new branch.
</p>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section" id="Make_a_Commit">
		<header><h3>Make a Commit</h3></header>
		<p>
			On GitHub, saved changes are called <em>commits</em>. Each commit has an associated <em>commit message</em>, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
		</p>
		<h4>Make and commit changes</h4>
		<ol class="section-ol">
			<li>Click the <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
			<li>Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.</li>
			<li>In the editor, write a bit about yourself.</li>
			<li>Write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Commit changes</strong> button.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section" id="Open_a_Pull_Request">
		<header><h3>Open a Pull Request</h3></header>
		<p>
			Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a <em>pull request</em>, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show <em>diffs</em>, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.
		</p>
		<h4>Open a Pull Request for changes to the README</h4>
		<ol class="section-ol">
			<li>Click the <strong>Pull Request</strong> tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green <strong>New pull request</strong> button.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Example Comparisons</strong> box, select the branch you made, <code>readme-edits</code>, to compare with <code>master</code> (the original).</li>
			<li>Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.</li>
			<li>When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green <strong>Create Pull Request</strong> button.</li>
			<li>Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>When you're done with your message, click <strong>Create pull request!</strong></p>
	</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Merge_your_Pull_Request">
	<header><h3>Merge your Pull Request</h3></header>
	<p>In this final step, it's time to bring your changes together - merging your <code>readme-edits</code> branch into the <code>master</code> branch.
	</p>
	<ol class="section-ol">
		<li>Click the green <strong>Merge pull request</strong> button to merge the changes into <code>master</code>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Confirm merge</strong>.</li>
		<li>Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the <strong>Delete branch</strong> button in the purple box.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Celebrate!</h4>
	<p>By completing this tutorial, you've learned to create a project and make a pull a request on GitHub!</p>
